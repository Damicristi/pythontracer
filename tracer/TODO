* filter to remove uninteresting functions
  * by minimum cum time
* sort?
* enable search

Not really necessary:
* replace  filename:func_name  with  filename:class_name.method_name  if method
* show generator.next() differently to a normal call, maybe show the func_name.next() or something like that
* Add more information about call/ret (params, ret value -- print their types? ids?)
