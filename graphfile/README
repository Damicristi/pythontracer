Graphfile is a graph serialization library.

It is currently of limited scope and only meant to support write in
append-only mode where nodes must consist of a binary blob, and links
to other nodes.

The serialized file has the following format:

Offsets are 64-bit large.
The file begins with the offset, in the file, of the "root" node.
The bytes at that offset will contain a Node, of the structure:

Type           Name
64-bit,buffer  Arbitrary data of the root node
64-bit,Offsets Offsets of linked nodes from the root node

Each offset of Offsets will also be a Node.
